"""
Ember's Diaries — Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
Guarantees crash safety. Before any record is written to the store,
it is logged here first. On startup, incomplete writes are recovered.

Protocol:
  1. Write WAL entry (PENDING)
  2. Write record to store
  3. Mark WAL entry COMMITTED
  4. On crash recovery: any PENDING entries are replayed
